Installation
------------

Follow the steps in any one of these methods to install or update a Hugo
theme.

### Method - Using hugo mod

Add hugo-xterm theme as Hugo module to hide the theme content and let you
focus only on your site content. Let Hugo handle the theme updates
automatically and control the theme as a Hugo module instead of git.

```bash
cd <your-site-directory>

# initialize your site as a hugo module.
hugo mod init <your-repo-host/your-username/your-site-repo>

# import hugo-xterm theme as hugo module in configuration
$ cat config/_default/config.toml
[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/manid2/hugo-xterm"

# update theme
hugo mod get -u
```

For all below methods your site needs to point to hugo-xterm theme
subdirectory in configuration as below:

```bash
$ cat config/_default/config.toml
theme = "hugo-xterm"
```

### Method - Download and copy theme

Download the archived (i.e. .zip or tar.gz) theme from github repository
releases page. Extract and copy the contents into `themes/hugo-xterm`
subdirectory in your site directory.

To update the theme just download a new release and overwrite the same
subdirectory.

This method is simple, can be automated with script and saves space on disk by
omitting the theme repository history.

### Method - Using git clone

This method clones the theme repository with history into your site's themes
subdirectory which is useful if you want to control the history or make your
own private modifications to the theme.

```bash
cd <your-site-directory>
git clone https://github.com/manid2/hugo-xterm themes/hugo-xterm --depth=1

# update theme
cd themes/hugo-xterm
git pull
```

### Method - Using git submodule

This is similar to cloning the theme into subdirectory except using git
submodule which makes the theme acts a dependency of your site repository. It
lets git to control your site and its dependency this theme.

```bash
git submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/manid2/hugo-xterm \
themes/hugo-xterm

# update theme
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

Local development
-----------------

```bash
# add to go.mod for local development
# replace github.com/manid2/hugo-xterm => ../hugo-xterm
hugo server --source exampleSite
```
